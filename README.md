# 🏠 **House Price Prediction**

A clean, modern, and fully documented machine learning project designed to predict residential property prices using advanced data preprocessing and regression models.

---

# 🧠 **Overview**

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques based on various features of residential properties. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and training multiple regression models. The system also includes a full-stack web interface built by **Aniruddha Nagesh Salvankar**, allowing prediction and model training directly through a browser.
