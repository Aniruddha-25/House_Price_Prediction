# üè† House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques based on various features of residential properties. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and training multiple regression models. The project compares different models to select the best-performing one for accurate price prediction.

# Features
